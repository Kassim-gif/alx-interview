02. Minimum Operations
Concepts Needed:
Dynamic Programming:

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

Prime Factorization:

Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.

Code Optimization:

Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
How to optimize Python code
Greedy Algorithms:

The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.

Min operations py
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return
